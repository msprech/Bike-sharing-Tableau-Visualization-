# NYC Bike Share Analysis

## Purpose

NYC's Citi Bike program provides both financial and social benefits through a strong business model and clientele base. This analysis seeks to highlight what aspects make the program so successful, as well as if those characteristics could be emulated in a bike share business in Iowa. 

Citi Bike travel data was analyzed using Tableau and Python to create a [thorough presentation](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/molly.sprecher/viz/BikeAnalysis_16391914354240/Story1?publish=yes "thorough presentation") of the data. 

## Results

The Citi Bike program was remarkably popular in August, with 2,344,224 trips taken in that month alone.

This heatmap shows the spread of popular start and stoptimes for bike checkouts and rides. The most popular hours were between the 5-6pm range on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday. Monday through Friday morning also showed heavy ridership. Saturdays and Sundays had the most consistent popularity throughout the day.

This chart portrays checkout times per user by both hours and minutes. It is worth noting here that there was a good a good number of users who took the bikes for longer periods of time, peaking at the 5-hour mark. Users after that point declined.

This map shows the top starting locations for bike rides, the vast majority of which were concentrated around a central location.

This chart shows the trip duration times by hours, minutes, and gender. A key takeaway here is that the majority of ridership, particularly for longer bike rides, were male.

Another look at the gender spread of the users shows again that males were the most prevalent riders. Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday from 5-6pm were again very popular ride times.

This heatmap shows user trips by gender, customer type, and by weekday. Unknown gender users tended to be one-time customers rather than subscribers. Both females and males represented were more commonly subscribers than one-time customers. One-time customers also tended to visit on Saturdays, while Thursday was the most popular day for subscribers.

This pie chart enhances the view of the ratio of customer to subscriber usertypes. Subscribers made up 1,900,359 of the total users, in comparison to 443,865 one-time customers. 

## Summary 

The analysis of the NYC bike program shows promising results for a similar business in Iowa. The primary type of users were subscribers, showing that the program inspires a loyal client base who uses the bikes on a regular basis. The results also showed that the bike program is popular throughout the week, with substantial ridership concentrated in the mornings and evenings, as well as on the weekend. 

Longer bike trips were also common, which shows the positive user attitude toward the bike service. 

Although this analysis showed the potential for a bike sharing program in Iowa, it is worth it to engage in further analysis. Additional visualizations should also be created to explore available bike data and location possibilities within Iowa. Another visualization should focus on the most popular routes taken by users, as well as what attractions draw in most users. There should also be further insight conducted into creating a user profile, such as charting the most popular ages of riders.
